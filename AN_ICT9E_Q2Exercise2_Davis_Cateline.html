<h1>Hot Freaks - Write Me Letters</h1>
<p class="p1">On the fridge, there's a card this girl wrote<br>
To my roommates thanking them for<br>
Coming to her birthday party<br>
I am sad, I wish that I had friends like that<br>
Someone to play Frisbee on most days<br>
Someone take me to the MOA</p>

<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Shakira baby, I wish you cared about me<br>
I wish you knew how I feel<br>
I wish you knew I was real<br>
I wish a person like you<br>
Would like a person like me<br>
It's the reason I hide, always aside<br>
Afraid that nobody will think I'm special</p>

<p>Write me letters, ink on paper<br>
I'm so mixed up I could cry<br>
What's your secret? I can keep it<br>
I can keep it till I die<br>
I'm not happy, I'm just worried<br>
Things don't ever turn out right<br>
Won't you help me, write me letters?<br>
Write me letters in the sky<br>
Woah oh oh oh</p>

<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Recently, I got paid to scan my brain<br>
And paid to answer personal questions<br>
Like, "do I think I am a worthless person?"<br>
I talk too much, you know I told 'em everything<br>
I told them that I'd like to disappear<br>
I told them that I have nobody here<br>
I know that's not what I was taught (ah ah ah ah)<br>
I hope that someday it's not something (ah ah ah ah) that I want<br>
As for the moment I just want to be (ahh) absent</p>

<p>Write me letters, ink on paper<br>
I'm so mixed up I could cry<br>
What's your secret? I can keep it<br>
I can keep it till I die<br>
I'm not happy, I'm just worried<br>
Things don't ever turn out right<br>
Won't you help me, write me letters?<br>
Write me letters in the sky</p>

<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Oh, watch it all go by<br>
Having no fun, having no fun<br>
Watch it all go, watch it all go by<br>
Having no fun<br>
I'm having no fun<br>
I'm having no fun</p>
